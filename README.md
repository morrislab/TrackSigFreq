# Load the package in R
`devtools::install_github("morrislab/TrackSigFreq")`

# Demo
Using the example data provided in `extdata/`, the following code will plot the signature trajectory, and return the fitted mixture of signatures for each bin, the bins where changepoints were detected, and the ggplot object.

```r
library(TrackSig)
library(ggplot2)

vcfFile = system.file(package = "TrackSig", "extdata/Example.vcf")
cnaFile = system.file(package = "TrackSig", "extdata/Example_cna.txt")
purity = 1
activeInSample = c("SBS1", "SBS5", "SBS3", "SBS9")

set.seed(1224)

# a warning will appear about not matching the refrence genome, this is because the
# example vcf file is generated by sampling random nucleotides, not real mutations. 
example <- TrackSig(vcfFile, activeInSample, cnaFile, purity)

```

# Note

Some users may have plotting issues with `TrackSig` if `ggplot2` is not explicitly loaded with `library(ggplot2)`. We are experiencing a bug that has been [previously described](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/663) for `ggplot2`.
