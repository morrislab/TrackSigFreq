Title: TrackSig - cancer evolutionary trajectory estimation
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Cait Harrigan, implemented with reference to TrackSig by Yulia Rubanova
Maintainer: Cait Harrigan <cait.harrigan@utoronto.ca>
Description: TrackSig, to estimate the evolutionary trajectories of signatures
             of somatic mutational processes. TrackSig uses cancer cell fraction (CCF) 
             corrected by copy number to infer anapproximate order in which the somatic
             mutations accumulate. TrackSig segments mutation ordering by CCF and fits 
             signature exposures (activities) as a piece-wise constant function of the 
             mutation ordering. TrackSig uses optimal segmentation to find the points of
             change in signature activities.
